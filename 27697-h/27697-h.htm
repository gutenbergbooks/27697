<span class = "firstword">hilst</span> you were sleeping, little
Dear-my-soul, strange things happened; but that I saw and heard them,
I&nbsp;should never have believed them. The clock stood, of course, in
the corner, a&nbsp;moonbeam floated idly on the floor, and a little
mauve mouse came from the hole in the chimney corner and frisked and
scampered in the light of the moonbeam upon the floor. The little mauve
mouse was particu&shy;larly merry; sometimes she danced upon two legs
and sometimes upon four legs, but always very daintily and always very
merrily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, me!&rdquo; sighed the old clock, &ldquo;how different mice
are nowadays from the mice we used to have in the good old times! Now
there was your grandma, Mistress Velvetpaw,
<span class = "pagenum">[8]</span>
and there was your grandpa, Master Sniff&shy;whisker,&mdash;how grave
and dignified they were! Many a night have I seen them dancing upon the
carpet below me, but always the stately minuet and never that crazy
frisking which you are executing now, to my surprise&mdash;yes, and to
my horror, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why shouldn&rsquo;t I be merry?&rdquo; asked the little
mauve mouse. &ldquo;Tomorrow is Christmas, and this is Christmas
eve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it is,&rdquo; said the old clock. &ldquo;I&nbsp;had really
forgotten all about it. But, tell me, what is Christmas to you, little
Miss Mauve Mouse?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A great deal to me!&rdquo; cried the little mauve mouse.
&ldquo;I&nbsp;have been very good a very long time: I&nbsp;have not used
any bad words, nor have I gnawed any holes, nor have I stolen any canary
seed, nor have I worried my mother by running behind the flour-barrel
where that horrid trap is set. In fact, I&nbsp;have been so good that I
am very sure Santa Claus will bring me something very pretty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This seemed to amuse the old clock mightily; in fact the old clock
fell to laughing so heartily that in an unguarded moment she struck
twelve instead of ten, which was exceed&shy;ingly careless and therefore
to be repre&shy;hended.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">[9]</span>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you silly little mauve mouse,&rdquo; said the old clock,
&ldquo;you don&rsquo;t believe in Santa Claus, do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I do,&rdquo; answered the little mauve mouse.
&ldquo;Believe in Santa Claus? Why shouldn&rsquo;t I? Didn&rsquo;t Santa
Claus bring me a beautiful butter-cracker last Christmas, and a lovely
ginger&shy;snap, and a delicious rind of cheese,
and&mdash;and&mdash;lots of things? I&nbsp;should be very ungrateful if
I did <i>not</i> believe in Santa Claus, and I certainly shall not
disbelieve in him at the very moment when I am expecting him to arrive
with a bundle of goodies for&nbsp;me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I once had a little sister,&rdquo; continued the little mauve
mouse, &ldquo;who did not believe in Santa Claus, and the very thought
of the fate that befell her makes my blood run cold and my whiskers
stand on end. She died before I was born, but my mother has told me all
about her. Perhaps you never saw her: her name was Squeak&shy;nibble,
and she was in stature one of those long, low, rangy mice that are
seldom found in well-stocked pantries. Mother says that
Squeak&shy;nibble took after our ancestors who came from New England,
where the malignant ingenuity of the people and the ferocity of the cats
rendered life precarious indeed. Squeak&shy;nibble seemed to inherit
many ancestral traits,
<span class = "pagenum">[10]</span>
the most conspi&shy;cuous of which was a dispo&shy;sition to sneer at
some of the most respected dogmas in mousedom. From her very infancy she
doubted, for example, the widely accepted theory that the moon was
composed of green cheese; and this heresy was the first intima&shy;tion
her parents had of the sceptical turn of her mind. Of course her parents
were vastly annoyed, for their maturer natures saw that this youthful
scepti&shy;cism portended serious, if not fatal, conse&shy;quences. Yet
all in vain did the sagacious couple reason and plead with their
headstrong and heretical child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For a long time Squeak&shy;nibble would not believe that there
was any such archfiend as a cat; but she came to be convinced to the
contrary one memorable night, on which occasion she lost two inches of
her beautiful tail, and received so terrible a fright that for fully an
hour afterward her little heart beat so violently as to lift her off her
feet and bump her head against the top of our domestic hole. The cat
that deprived my sister of so large a percentage of her vertebral
colophon was the same brindled ogress that nowadays steals ever and anon
into this room, crouches treacher&shy;ously behind the sofa, and feigns
to be asleep, hoping, forsooth, that some of us, heedless of her hated
<span class = "pagenum">[11]</span>
presence, will venture within reach of her diabolical claws. So enraged
was this ferocious monster at the escape of my sister that she ground
her fangs viciously together, and vowed to take no pleasure in life
until she held in her devouring jaws the innocent little mouse which
belonged to the mangled bit of tail she even then clutched in her
remorse&shy;less claws.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the old clock, &ldquo;now that you recall the
incident, I&nbsp;recollect it well. I&nbsp;was here then, in this very
corner, and I remember that I laughed at the cat and chided her for her
awkward&shy;ness. My reproaches irritated her; she told me that a
clock&rsquo;s duty was to run itself down, <i>not</i> to be
depreci&shy;ating the merits of others! Yes, I&nbsp;recall the time;
that cat&rsquo;s tongue is fully as sharp as her claws.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be that as it may,&rdquo; said the little mauve mouse,
&ldquo;it is a matter of history, and therefore beyond dispute, that
from that very moment the cat pined for Squeak&shy;nibble&rsquo;s life;
it seemed as if that one little two-inch taste of
Squeak&shy;nibble&rsquo;s tail had filled the cat with a consuming
passion, or appetite, for the rest of Squeak&shy;nibble. So the cat
waited and watched and hunted and schemed and devised and did
every&shy;thing possible for a cat&mdash;a cruel cat&mdash;to do in
order to gain her murderous ends. One
<span class = "pagenum">[12]</span>
night&mdash;one fatal Christmas eve&mdash;our mother had undressed the
children for bed, and was urging upon them to go to sleep earlier than
usual, since she fully expected that Santa Claus would bring each of
them something very palatable and nice before morning. Thereupon the
little dears whisked their cunning tails, pricked up their beautiful
ears, and began telling one another what they hoped Santa Claus would
bring. One asked for a slice of Roquefort, another for Neuf&shy;chatel,
another for Sap Sago, and a fourth for Edam; one expressed a
prefer&shy;ence for de Brie, while another hoped to get Parmesan; one
clamored for imperial blue Stilton, and another craved the fragrant boon
of Caprera. There were fourteen little ones then, and conse&shy;quently
there were diverse opinions as to the kind of gift which Santa Claus
should best bring; still, there was, as you can readily under&shy;stand,
an enthusi&shy;astic unanimity upon this point, namely, that the gift
should be cheese of some brand or other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My dears,&rsquo; said our mother, &lsquo;what matters
it whether the boon which Santa Claus brings be royal English cheddar or
fromage de Bricquebec, Vermont sage, or Herkimer County skim-milk? We
should be content with what&shy;soever Santa Claus bestows, so long as
it be
<span class = "pagenum">[13]</span>
cheese, disjoined from all traps what&shy;soever, unmixed with Paris
green, and free from glass, strych&shy;nine, and other harmful
ingre&shy;dients. As for myself, I&nbsp;shall be satisfied with a cut of
nice, fresh, Western reserve; for truly I recognise in no other viand or
edible half the fragrance or half the gustful&shy;ness to be met with in
one of these pale but aromatic domestic products. So run away to your
dreams now, that Santa Claus may find you sleeping.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The children obeyed,&mdash;all but Squeak&shy;nibble.
&lsquo;Let the others think what they please,&rsquo; said she,
&lsquo;but I don&rsquo;t believe in Santa Claus. I&rsquo;m not going to
bed either. I&rsquo;m going to creep out of this dark hole and have a
quiet romp, all by myself, in the moonlight.&rsquo; Oh, what a vain,
foolish, wicked little mouse was Squeak&shy;nibble! But I will not
reproach the dead; her punish&shy;ment came all too swiftly. Now listen:
who do you suppose overheard her talking so disrespect&shy;fully of
Santa Claus?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Santa Claus himself,&rdquo; said the old clock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; answered the little mauve mouse. &ldquo;It was
that wicked, murderous cat! Just as Satan lurks and lies in wait for bad
children, so does the cruel cat lie in wait for naughty little mice. And
you can depend upon it that,
<span class = "pagenum">[14]</span>
when that awful cat heard Squeak&shy;nibble speak so
disrespect&shy;fully of Santa Claus, her wicked eyes glowed with joy,
her sharp teeth watered, and her bristling fur emitted electric sparks
as big as marrowfat peas. Then what did that blood-thirsty monster do
but scuttle as fast as she could into Dear-my-Soul&rsquo;s room, leap up
into Dear-my-Soul&rsquo;s crib, and walk off with the pretty little
white muff which Dear-my-Soul used to wear when she went for a visit to
the little girl in the next block! What upon earth did the horrid old
cat want with Dear-my-Soul&rsquo;s pretty little white muff? Ah, the
duplicity, the diabolical ingenuity of that cat! Listen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the first place,&rdquo; resumed the little mauve mouse,
after a pause that testified eloquently to the depth of her
emotion,&mdash;&ldquo;in the first place, that wretched cat dressed
herself up in that pretty little white muff, by which you are to
under&shy;stand that she crawled through the muff just so far as to
leave her four cruel legs at liberty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I under&shy;stand,&rdquo; said the old clock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then she put on the boy doll&rsquo;s fur cap,&rdquo; said the
little mauve mouse, &ldquo;and when she was arrayed in the boy
doll&rsquo;s fur cap and Dear-my-Soul&rsquo;s pretty little white muff,
of course
<span class = "pagenum">[15]</span>
she didn&rsquo;t look like a cruel cat at all. But whom did she look
like?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like the boy doll,&rdquo; suggested the old clock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; cried the little mauve mouse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like Dear-my-Soul?&rdquo; asked the old clock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How stupid you are!&rdquo; exclaimed the little mauve mouse.
&ldquo;Why, she looked like Santa Claus, of course!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; I see,&rdquo; said the old clock. &ldquo;Now I begin
to be inter&shy;ested; go on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; sighed the little mauve mouse, &ldquo;not much
remains to be told; but there is more of my story left than there was of
Squeak&shy;nibble when that horrid cat crawled out of that miserable
disguise. You are to under&shy;stand that, contrary to her sagacious
mother&rsquo;s injunc&shy;tion, and in notorious derision of the mooted
coming of Santa Claus, Squeak&shy;nibble issued from the friendly hole
in the chimney corner, and gambolled about over this very carpet, and,
I&nbsp;dare say, in this very moonlight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; said the moonbeam faintly.
&ldquo;I&nbsp;am so very old, and I have seen so many things&mdash;I do
not know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right merrily was Squeak&shy;nibble gambolling,&rdquo;
continued the little mauve mouse, &ldquo;and she had just turned a
double back somer&shy;sault without the use of what remained of her tail
<span class = "pagenum">[16]</span>
when, all of a sudden, she beheld, looming up like a monster ghost,
a&nbsp;figure all in white fur! Oh, how frightened she was, and how her
little heart did beat! &lsquo;Purr, purr-r-r,&rsquo; said the ghost in
white fur. &lsquo;Oh, please don&rsquo;t hurt me!&rsquo; pleaded
Squeak&shy;nibble. &lsquo;No; I&rsquo;ll not hurt you,&rsquo; said the
ghost in white fur; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m Santa Claus, and I&rsquo;ve brought
you a beautiful piece of savory old cheese, you dear little mousie,
you.&rsquo; Poor Squeak&shy;nibble was deceived; a&nbsp;sceptic all her
life, she was at last befooled by the most palpable and most fatal of
frauds. &lsquo;How good of you!&rsquo; said Squeak&shy;nibble.
&lsquo;I&nbsp;didn&rsquo;t believe there was a Santa Claus,
and&mdash;&rsquo; but before she could say more she was seized by two
sharp, cruel claws that conveyed her crushed body to the murderous mouth
of mousedom&rsquo;s most malignant foe. I&nbsp;can dwell no longer upon
this harrowing scene. Suffice it to say that ere the morrow&rsquo;s sun
rose like a big yellow Herkimer County cheese upon the spot where that
tragedy had been enacted, poor Squeak&shy;nibble passed to that bourn
whence two inches of her beautiful tail had preceded her by the space of
three weeks to a day. As for Santa Claus, when he came that Christmas
eve, bringing morceaux de Brie and of Stilton for the other little mice,
he heard with sorrow
<span class = "pagenum">[17]</span>
of Squeak&shy;nibble&rsquo;s fate; and ere he departed he said that in
all his experi&shy;ence he had never known of a mouse or of a child that
had prospered after once saying that he didn&rsquo;t believe in Santa
Claus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that is a remark&shy;able story,&rdquo; said the old
clock. &ldquo;But if you believe in Santa Claus, why aren&rsquo;t you in
bed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where I shall be presently,&rdquo; answered the
little mauve mouse, &ldquo;but I must have my scamper you know. It is
very pleasant, I&nbsp;assure you, to frolic in the light of the moon;
only I cannot under&shy;stand why you are always so cold and so solemn
and so still, you pale, pretty little moonbeam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I do not know that I am so,&rdquo; said the moonbeam.
&ldquo;But I am very old, and I have travelled many, many, leagues, and
I have seen wondrous things. Sometimes I toss upon the ocean, sometimes
I fall upon a slumbering flower, sometimes I rest upon a dead
child&rsquo;s face. I&nbsp;see the fairies at their play, and I hear
mothers singing lullabies. Last night I swept across the frozen bosom of
a river. A&nbsp;woman&rsquo;s face looked up at me; it was the picture
of eternal rest. &lsquo;She is sleeping,&rsquo; said the frozen river.
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll rock her to and fro, and sing to her. Pass gently by,
O&nbsp;moonbeam; pass gently by, lest you awaken her.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<span class = "pagenum">[18]</span>
<p>&ldquo;How strangely you talk,&rdquo; said the old clock. &ldquo;Now,
I&rsquo;ll warrant me that, if you wanted to, you could tell many a
pretty and wonderful story. You must know many a Christmas tale; pray,
tell us one to wear away this night of Christmas watching.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know but one,&rdquo; said the moonbeam. &ldquo;I&nbsp;have
told it over and over again, in every land and in every home; yet I do
not weary of it. It is very simple. Should you like to hear
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed we should,&rdquo; said the old clock; &ldquo;but before
you begin, let me strike twelve; for I shouldn&rsquo;t want to interrupt
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the old clock had performed this duty with somewhat more than
usual alacrity, the moonbeam began its story:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Upon a time&mdash;so long ago that I can&rsquo;t tell how long
ago it was&mdash;I fell upon a hill-side. It was in a far distant
country; this I know, because, although it was the Christmas time, it
was not in that country as it is wont to be in countries to the north.
Hither the snow-king never came; flowers bloomed all the year, and at
all times the lambs found pleasant pasturage on the hill-sides. The
night wind was balmy, and there was a fragrance of cedar in its breath.
There were violets on the hill-side, and I fell amongst them and lay
there. I&nbsp;kissed them, and
<span class = "pagenum">[19]</span>
they awakened. &lsquo;Ah, is it you, little moonbeam?&rsquo; they said,
and they nestled in the grass which the lambs had left uncropped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A shepherd lay upon a broad stone on the hill-side; above him
spread an olive-tree, old, ragged, and gloomy; but now it swayed its
rusty branches majestic&shy;ally in the shifting air of night. The
shepherd&rsquo;s name was Benoni. Wearied with long watching, he had
fallen asleep; his crook had slipped from his hand. Upon the hill-side,
too, slept the shepherd&rsquo;s flock. I&nbsp;had counted them again and
again; I&nbsp;had stolen across their gentle faces and brought them
pleasant dreams of green pastures and of cool water-brooks. I&nbsp;had
kissed old Benoni, too, as he lay slumbering there; and in his dreams he
seemed to see Israel&rsquo;s King come upon earth, and in his dreams he
murmured the promised Messiah&rsquo;s name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah, is it you, little moonbeam?&rsquo; quoth the
violets. &lsquo;You have come in good time. Nestle here with us, and see
wonderful things come to pass.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What are these wonderful things of which you
speak?&rsquo; I&nbsp;asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We heard the old olive-tree telling of them
to-night,&rsquo; said the violets. &lsquo;Do not go to sleep, little
violets,&rsquo; said the old olive-tree, &lsquo;for
<span class = "pagenum">[20]</span>
this is Christmas night, and the Master shall walk upon the hill-side in
the glory of the midnight hour.&rsquo; So we waited and watched; one by
one the lambs fell asleep; one by one the stars peeped out; the shepherd
nodded and crooned, and crooned and nodded, and at last he, too, went
fast asleep, and his crook slipped from his keeping. Then we called to
the old olive-tree yonder, asking how soon the midnight hour would come;
but all the old olive-tree answered was &lsquo;Presently,
presently,&rsquo; and finally we, too, fell asleep, wearied by our long
watching, and lulled by the rocking and swaying of the old olive-tree in
the breezes of the night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But who is this Master?&rsquo; I&nbsp;asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A child, a little child,&rsquo; they answered.
&lsquo;He is called the little Master by the others. He comes here
often, and plays among the flowers of the hill-side. Sometimes the
lambs, gambolling too care&shy;lessly, have crushed and bruised us so
that we lie bleeding and are like to die; but the little Master heals
our wounds and refreshes us once again.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I marvelled much to hear these things. &lsquo;The midnight
hour is at hand,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;and I will abide with you to see
this little Master of whom you speak.&rsquo; So we nestled among the
<span class = "pagenum">[21]</span>
verdure of the hill-side, and sang songs one to another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Come away!&rsquo; called the night wind;
&lsquo;I&nbsp;know a beauteous sea not far hence, upon whose bosom you
shall float, float, float, away out into the mists and clouds, if you
will come with me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I hid under the violets and amid the tall grass, that the
night wind might not woo me with its pleading. &lsquo;Ho, there, old
olive-tree!&rsquo; cried the violets; &lsquo;do you see the little
Master coming? Is not the midnight hour at hand?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I can see the town yonder,&rsquo; said the old
olive-tree. &lsquo;A&nbsp;star beams bright over Bethlehem, the iron
gates swing open, and the little Master comes.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two children came to the hill-side. The one, older than his
comrade, was Dimas, the son of Benoni. He was rugged and sinewy, and
over his brown shoulders was flung a goat-skin; a&nbsp;leathern cap did
not confine his long, dark curly hair. The other child was he whom they
called the little Master; about his slender form clung raiment white as
snow, and around his face of heavenly innocence fell curls of golden
yellow. So beautiful a child I had not seen before, nor have I ever
since seen such as he. And as they came together to the hill-side,
<span class = "pagenum">[22]</span>
there seemed to glow about the little Master&rsquo;s head a soft white
light, as if the moon had sent its tenderest, fairest beams to kiss
those golden curls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What sound was that?&rsquo; cried Dimas, for he was
exceeding fearful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Have no fear, Dimas,&rsquo; said the little Master.
&lsquo;Give me thy hand and I will lead thee.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Presently they came to the rock whereon Benoni, the shepherd,
lay; and they stood under the old olive-tree, and the old olive-tree
swayed no longer in the night wind, but bent its branches
rever&shy;ently in the presence of the little Master. It seemed as if
the wind, too, stayed in its shifting course just then; for suddenly
there was a solemn hush, and you could hear no noise, except that in his
dreams Benoni spoke the Messiah&rsquo;s name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Thy father sleeps,&rsquo; said the little Master,
&lsquo;and it is well that it is so; for that I love thee Dimas, and
that thou shalt walk with me in my Father&rsquo;s Kingdom, I&nbsp;would
show thee the glories of my birth&shy;right.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then all at once sweet music filled the air, and light,
greater than the light of day, illumined the sky and fell upon all that
hill-side. The heavens opened, and angels, singing joyous songs, walked
to the earth. More wondrous
<span class = "pagenum">[23]</span>
still, the stars, falling from their places in the sky, clustered upon
the old olive-tree, and swung hither and thither like colored lanterns.
The flowers of the hill-side all awakened, and they, too, danced and
sang. The angels, coming hither, hung gold and silver and jewels and
precious stones upon the old olive, where swung the stars; so that the
glory of that sight, though I might live forever, I&nbsp;shall never see
again. When Dimas heard and saw these things he fell upon his knees, and
catching the hem of the little Master&rsquo;s garment, he
kissed&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Greater joy than this shall be thine, Dimas,&rsquo;
said the little Master; &lsquo;but first must all things be
fulfilled.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All through that Christmas night did the angels come and go
with their sweet anthems; all through that Christmas night did the stars
dance and sing; and when it came my time to steal away, the hill-side
was still beautiful with the glory and the music of heaven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, is that all?&rdquo; asked the old clock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the moonbeam; &ldquo;but I am nearly done. The
years went on. Sometimes I tossed upon the ocean&rsquo;s bosom,
sometimes I scampered o&rsquo;er a battle-field, sometimes I lay upon a
dead child&rsquo;s face. I&nbsp;heard the voices of Darkness and
<span class = "pagenum">[24]</span>
mothers&rsquo; lullabies and sick men&rsquo;s prayers&mdash;and so the
years went&nbsp;on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fell one night upon a hard and furrowed face. It was of
ghostly pallor. A&nbsp;thief was dying on the cross, and this was his
wretched face. About the cross stood men with staves and swords and
spears, but none paid heed unto the thief. Somewhat beyond this cross
another was lifted up, and upon it was stretched a human body my light
fell not upon. But I heard a voice that somewhere I had heard
before,&mdash;though where I did not know,&mdash;and this voice blessed
those that railed and jeered and shame&shy;fully entreated. And suddenly
the voice called &lsquo;Dimas, Dimas!&rsquo; and the thief upon whose
hardened face I rested made answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I saw that it was Dimas; yet to this wicked criminal
there remained but little of the shepherd child whom I had seen in all
his innocence upon the hill-side. Long years of sinful life had seared
their marks into his face; yet now, at the sound of that familiar voice,
somewhat of the old-time boyish look came back, and in the yearning of
the anguished eyes I seemed to see the shepherd&rsquo;s son again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The Master!&rsquo; cried Dimas, and he stretched forth
his neck that he might see him that spake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;O Dimas, how art thou changed!&rsquo; cried
<span class = "pagenum">[25]</span>
the Master, yet there was in his voice no tone of rebuke save that which
cometh of love.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then Dimas wept, and in that hour he forgot his pain. And the
Master&rsquo;s consoling voice and the Master&rsquo;s presence there
wrought in the dying criminal such a new spirit, that when at last his
head fell upon his bosom, and the men about the cross said that he was
dead, it seemed as if I shined not upon a felon&rsquo;s face, but upon
the face of the gentle shepherd lad, the son of Benoni.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And shining on that dead and peaceful face, I&nbsp;bethought
me of the little Master&rsquo;s words that he had spoken under the old
olive-tree upon the hill-side: &lsquo;Your eyes behold the promised
glory now, O&nbsp;Dimas,&rsquo; I&nbsp;whispered, &lsquo;for with the
Master you walk in Paradise.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p class = "space">
Ah, little Dear-my-Soul, you know&mdash;you know whereof the moonbeam
spake. The shepherd&rsquo;s bones are dust, the flocks are scattered,
the old olive-tree is gone, the flowers of the hill-side are withered,
and none knoweth where the grave of Dimas is made. But last night,
again, there shined a star over Bethlehem, and the angels descended from
the sky to earth, and the stars sang together in glory. And the
bells,&mdash;hear them, little Dear-my-Soul,
<span class = "pagenum">[26]</span>
how sweetly they are ringing,&mdash;the bells bear us the good tidings
of great joy this Christmas morning, that our Christ is born, and that
with him he bringeth peace on earth and good-will toward men.</p>
